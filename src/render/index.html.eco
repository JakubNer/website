    <h3>Own your data</h3>
    <p>
      Everything in one place â€“ your place. Use a storage account with a
      provider you trust, or set up your own storage server. Move house whenever you
      want. It&#39;s your data.

    <h3>Stay in sync</h3>
    <p>
      remoteStorage-enabled apps automatically sync your data across all of
      your devices, from desktop to tablet to smartphone, and maybe even your TV.

    <h3>Compatibility &amp; choice</h3>
    <p>
      Use the same data across different apps. Create a to-do list in one
      app, and track the time on your tasks in another one. Say goodbye to data
      silos.

    <h3>Go offline</h3>
    <p>
      Most remoteStorage-enabled apps come with first-class offline support.
      Use your apps offline on the go, and automatically sync when you&#39;re
      back online.
