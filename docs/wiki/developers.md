# remoteStorage.js

[remoteStorage.js](https://github.com/remotestorage/remotestorage.js/) is a JavaScript library that does all the heavy-lifting of connecting remoteStorage accounts, caching, synchronizing and storing user data. It is well-tested in all modern browsers, and also works in Cordova apps and node.js programs.

As the reference client, maintained by the RS core team, it always supports the latest protocol versions (but is reasonably backwards-compatible as well).
